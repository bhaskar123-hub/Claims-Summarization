Received photos from claimant at 415-4567 showing roof edge damage and debris. I analyzed photo set for initial damage classification and noted areas requiring closer inspection. I called the claimant to explain findings and recommended a certified roofing estimate to confirm scope. The claimant agreed to obtain estimates and asked for contractor recommendations, which I provided.
