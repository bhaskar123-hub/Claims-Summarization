Finalized file review for initial intake and verified all required forms submitted except for the subcontractor estimate. I called the claimant at 708-1234 to confirm expected arrival of the estimate and noted a target submission date. I updated the file with current status and set reminders for reassessment after estimate receipt. If estimate is not received by target date, next step is outreach to the repair vendor.
