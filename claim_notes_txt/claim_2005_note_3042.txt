Claimant provided an extensive photo set and I reviewed images showing interior and exterior damage patterns. I contacted the claimant at 415-6789 to walk through each photo and capture additional context such as prior condition and recent maintenance. I advised on any additional photo angles that would assist valuation and requested an itemized list of damaged contents. Logged instructions and next steps.
