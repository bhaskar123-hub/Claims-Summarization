Finalized a comprehensive file review noting that most documentation has been received and only a few items remain outstanding. I contacted the claimant at 415-6789 to summarize the pending items and confirm expected delivery dates. I advised the claimant on next steps toward valuation and provided an estimated timeline for settlement review. File is ready for final inspection scheduling once outstanding items are closed.
