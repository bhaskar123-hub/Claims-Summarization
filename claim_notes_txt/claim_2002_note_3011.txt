Called the claimant at 312-3456 to clarify the property areas affected and confirm the sequence of events. The claimant described damage to the exterior siding after a wind event and provided timestamps for when the incident occurred. I asked the claimant to take wide and close-up photos to capture extent and any serial numbers for damaged equipment. Arranged for a contractor referral and requested the claimant upload photos to the portal for review.
