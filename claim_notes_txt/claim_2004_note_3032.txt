Spoke with claimant at 206-5678 regarding several areas of property damage and collected detailed descriptions of each affected area. The claimant described visible water staining, warped flooring, and damaged furniture. I advised on documenting structural and non-structural items separately and requested itemized lists where possible. Arranged for an inspector to prioritize structural concerns.
