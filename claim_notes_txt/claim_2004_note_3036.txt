File intervention initiated to coordinate multi-vendor repairs after conflicting contractor scopes were submitted. I contacted the claimant at 206-5678 to explain the need for a consolidated scope and proposed an independent estimate. The claimant accepted and I scheduled the independent estimate. Noted timeline adjustments and vendor liaison tasks in the file.
