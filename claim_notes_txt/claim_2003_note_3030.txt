Completed an interim file review summarizing the current status: photos received, two contractor estimates pending, and injury documentation expected. I contacted the claimant at 415-4567 to confirm the timeline for outstanding items and offered assistance locating local vendors. The claimant appreciated the support and will provide updates as items are completed. Next scheduled review is in five business days.
