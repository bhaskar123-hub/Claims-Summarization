To-do: confirm receipt of photographic evidence and vendor estimate. I contacted the claimant at 708-1234 to remind them about outstanding photos and guided them on the angles and items that should be documented. The claimant agreed to upload the files to the claims portal by end of day tomorrow. I will update the file once files are received and notify the adjuster assigned for inspection.
