Discussed coverage applicability and potential limits on the claim with the claimant at 206-5678. I explained how the policy treats gradual damage versus sudden incidents and the threshold for coverage eligibility. The claimant asked for examples and I supplied relevant scenarios to illustrate potential outcomes. Documented the coverage conversation and claimant acceptance.
