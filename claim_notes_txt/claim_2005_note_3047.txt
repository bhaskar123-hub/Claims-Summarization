Claimant reported ongoing discomfort and we discussed the process for submitting medical bills and provider notes. I provided detailed instructions and a medical release to the claimant at 415-6789 and explained expected timelines for evaluation. The claimant intends to obtain records from their provider and share them via the portal. I will monitor receipt and update the file accordingly.
