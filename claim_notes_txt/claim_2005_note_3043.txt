Conducted a file review and reconciled documentation submitted to date with the claimant's inventory list. Several receipts were missing purchase dates and I asked the claimant at 415-6789 to locate proof of purchase where possible. I explained how purchase dates influence valuation and encouraged claimant to check credit card statements or vendor records. Follow-up arranged to re-evaluate once receipts are submitted.
