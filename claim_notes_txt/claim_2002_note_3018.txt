Discussed potential third party responsibility for falling debris and liability implications with claimant at 312-3456. Claimant provided the landlord contact and approximate timeline when the debris was noticed. I advised claimant to secure any camera footage and witness statements, then requested landlord contact information for subrogation considerations. Logged landlord contact info and created task to reach out once claimant consents.
