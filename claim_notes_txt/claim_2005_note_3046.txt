Initiated file intervention to consolidate multiple invoices and contractor scopes into a single review package. I coordinated with the claimant at 415-6789 to gather outstanding invoices and instructed them on how to label and upload each file. The claimant will compile and submit by the end of the week. I recorded the intervention and set an internal deadline for review.
