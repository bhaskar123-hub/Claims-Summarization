Initiated file intervention to expedite processing due to impending weather forecast that could worsen existing damage. I coordinated with the claimant at 415-4567 and advised temporary protective measures. I also contacted the emergency vendor and noted the scheduled mitigation appointment. Confirmed claimant consent and documented additional expenses authorization limit.
