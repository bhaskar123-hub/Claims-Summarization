Discussed potential injury reports with the claimant at 708-1234 following their statement of minor cuts sustained during the loss. I requested any medical documentation and informed claimant of the medical records release form required for evaluation. The claimant indicated they will seek medical attention and provide records within a week. Noted to follow up on receipt and escalate if records are delayed.
