Noted claimant reported a minor soft tissue strain during the incident and called claimant at 312-3456 to advise on medical documentation. I requested any medical provider notes or receipts to support the injury portion of the claim. The claimant will seek an appointment and forward records; I explained how records will be used for evaluation. Documented follow-up to verify receipt and add to claim file.
