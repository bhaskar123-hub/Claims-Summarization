Performed a detailed file review after receiving contractor responses and confirmed several missing signed authorizations. I reached out to the claimant at 415-4567 to request signed release forms to obtain third-party records. The claimant confirmed they will sign and return electronically. Added a reminder to the file to check for received authorizations before scheduling vendor inspections.
