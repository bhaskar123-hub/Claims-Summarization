Called the claimant at 708-1234 to confirm the initial loss details and timeline. The claimant provided a thorough account of events leading to the loss and described immediate mitigation steps taken to prevent further damage. I reviewed contact and policy details with the claimant and noted action items for evidence collection. Advised claimant to send high-resolution photos and any invoices via email and arranged a follow-up within three days.
