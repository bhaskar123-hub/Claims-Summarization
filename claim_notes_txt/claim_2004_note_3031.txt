Called the claimant at 206-5678 to update them on the claim progress and confirm preferred communication channels. The claimant confirmed email and phone are fine and provided an alternate contact. I recorded these preferences and confirmed the loss details to ensure file accuracy. Also reminded claimant to keep receipts for any temporary repairs and to photograph completed mitigation.
