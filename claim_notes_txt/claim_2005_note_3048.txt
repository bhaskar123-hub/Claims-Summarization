Reviewed potential liability contributors after reviewing sequence of events supplied by the claimant at 415-6789. I requested additional statements from a neighbor who witnessed the incident and provided guidance on how to collect a formal witness statement. The claimant will follow up with the neighbor and upload any notes or recordings. Noted a pending subrogation review once evidence is obtained.
