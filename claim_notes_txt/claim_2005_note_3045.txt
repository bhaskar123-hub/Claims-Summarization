Discussed coverage nuances and possible endorsements that may affect settlement. I explained the claims settlement options, including replacement and repair considerations, and how depreciation may be applied. The claimant asked for clarification on deductible handling and I provided examples tailored to their reported losses. Updated claimant expectations and documented the coverage conversation.
