Claimant reported persistent back soreness and asked about documentation requirements; I advised obtaining a provider note and itemized billing to support any injury claims. I provided the claimant at 206-5678 with the medical authorization form necessary to obtain records. The claimant will forward provider contact details and I will follow up when records are received. Logged the injury documentation task.
