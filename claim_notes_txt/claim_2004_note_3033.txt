Completed a comprehensive file review and identified discrepancies between claimant's initial inventory and later submissions. I contacted the claimant at 206-5678 to reconcile the differences and requested clarification on dates of purchase for certain items. I emphasized the importance of accurate inventories for valuation. The claimant agreed to revise and resubmit the supporting documents.
