To-do: confirm shipment of temporary repair materials and ensure vendor adherence to agreed scope. I spoke with the claimant at 415-6789 and reviewed the temporary repair checklist. The claimant confirmed materials were delivered and provided vendor contact information for verification. I created a task to confirm vendor compliance and requested photos of completed temporary repairs.
