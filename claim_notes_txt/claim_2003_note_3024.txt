To-do: obtain roof repair estimates and verify contractor insurance. I spoke with the claimant at 415-4567 and provided a contractor checklist and guidance on documentation requirements. The claimant will collect at least two estimates and upload them to the portal. Follow-up scheduled in seven days to review and move to the next stage.
