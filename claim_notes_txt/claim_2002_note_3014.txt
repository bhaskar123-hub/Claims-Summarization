To-do: obtain contractor estimate and verify contractor licensure. I spoke with the claimant at 312-3456 about recommended licensed contractors and provided a checklist for what should be included in the estimate. The claimant will contact two vendors for quotes and send copies through the portal. Follow-up scheduled in five days to review submitted estimates.
