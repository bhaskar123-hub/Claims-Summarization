Discussed coverage scope with claimant at 312-3456, clarifying wind coverage and exclusions that may apply. I explained how the policy handles deterioration versus sudden damage and the documentation needed to support the claim. The claimant asked about depreciation factors and I provided examples relevant to siding replacement. Updated file with coverage notes and advised claimant on next documentation steps.
