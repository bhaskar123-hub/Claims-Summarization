Conducted a file review following photo submission and identified missing proof of ownership for one affected item claimed as damaged. I reached out to the claimant at 312-3456 to request purchase receipts or registration documents. The claimant agreed to search for the receipts and will upload them once found. I documented the missing item and flagged for claim validation upon receipt.
