Discussed potential liability with claimant at 206-5678 after they noted a third party may be responsible for the occurrence. I asked for contact information and any related correspondence to support subrogation. The claimant will attempt to obtain written confirmation and provide it for review. Created an investigation task to validate third party responsibility when documents are submitted.
