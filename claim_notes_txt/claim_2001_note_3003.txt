Completed an initial file review after receiving the claimant narrative and preliminary documents. While reviewing, I flagged missing supporting documentation including signed authorization and proof of ownership for several affected items. I communicated the missing items to the claimant at 708-1234 and explained how those documents affect coverage evaluation. Follow-up scheduled for receipt verification and next review.
