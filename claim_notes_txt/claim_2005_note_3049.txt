Explained PIP and related reimbursement steps to claimant who reported minor treatment for an occupant. I clarified documentation requirements and advised the claimant at 415-6789 to submit itemized bills and treatment notes. The claimant agreed and will forward invoices. Added PIP items to the workflow for reconciliation once documentation is in.
