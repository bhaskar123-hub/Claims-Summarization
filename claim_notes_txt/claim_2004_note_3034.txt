To-do: secure formal repair timeline from chosen contractor and verify the contractor's license and insurance. I provided the claimant at 206-5678 with a checklist for vendor qualifications and requested certificates of insurance. The claimant will present documents before work begins and upload them to the portal. I logged a follow-up to confirm documentation receipt.
