Completed intermediate file review and summarized outstanding deliverables: independent estimate, medical records, and vendor insurance verification. I called the claimant at 206-5678 to confirm their plan to obtain the independent estimate and requested confirmation once tasks are complete. The claimant acknowledged and agreed to the plan. Set next review date and escalated to manager if items are delayed.
