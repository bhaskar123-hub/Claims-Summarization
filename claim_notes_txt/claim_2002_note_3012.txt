Received initial photos from claimant at 312-3456 and performed a preliminary assessment; photos indicate localized siding loss and possible water intrusion. I documented visible damage and recommended candidate repair scopes to be confirmed by on-site estimator. I called the claimant to explain my observations and suggested immediate temporary sealing to prevent further moisture. Noted next step to schedule estimator and collect formal estimate.
