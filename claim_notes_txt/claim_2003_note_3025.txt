Explained coverage limits and storm-related exclusions to the claimant at 415-4567, and clarified how deductible calculation will work for this claim. I also identified potential additional coverages applicable to debris removal. The claimant asked about gap coverage and I provided examples of scenarios that would apply. Documented the coverage discussion and claimant acknowledgements in the file.
