Claimant reported mild head soreness and called to confirm if immediate medical attention was needed; I advised seeking care as appropriate and asked claimant to document any visits. I explained medical records and billing submission requirements and provided a release form for providers. The claimant will update once appointments occur and submit records; I logged an injury follow-up task.
