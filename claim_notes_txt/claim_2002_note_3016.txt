Initiated a file intervention due to a disputed scope with the contractor estimate. I contacted the claimant at 312-3456 to inform them of the escalation and outlined the independent review process. The claimant expressed willingness to allow an independent adjuster to review the estimate. I scheduled the independent review and recorded timelines for completion and communication.
