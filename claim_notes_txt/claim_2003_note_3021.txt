Called the claimant at 415-4567 to verify contact details and confirm how they prefer to receive updates. The claimant requested email summaries and text reminders; I updated contact preferences in the file. We discussed the timeline of the loss and I confirmed dates and times to ensure accuracy of the incident report. I also requested the claimant to provide any receipts and photos by the end of the week.
