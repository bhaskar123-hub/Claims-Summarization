Explained procedural steps for PIP eligibility when claimant mentioned vehicle occupant minor injuries following the wind event. I outlined what medical costs are covered and documentation standards to submit for reimbursement. The claimant will compile invoices and receipts and upload them to the claim portal. I created a PIP checklist in the file and assigned next review.
