Initiated file intervention due to an urgent vendor request for access to the premises. I coordinated with the claimant at 708-1234 to allow inspection and provided instructions on securing the area for the vendor. I recorded vendor contact details and expected inspection window in the file. A confirmation email was sent to both the vendor and claimant outlining agreed appointment time.
