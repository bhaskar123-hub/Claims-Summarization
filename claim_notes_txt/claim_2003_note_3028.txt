Discussed liability questions after claimant expressed concerns about neighboring property maintenance and possible negligence. I collected the claimant's observations and requested any supporting photos or messages from the neighbor. I explained how alleged negligence will be investigated and the potential outcomes. Created a subtask to evaluate neighbor responsibility after evidence receipt.
