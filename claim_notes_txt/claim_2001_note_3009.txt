Explained personal injury protection (PIP) considerations to the claimant at 708-1234 who inquired about immediate medical expense coverage. I outlined eligible expenses, documentation standards, and the process for submitting medical bills. The claimant will forward any current and future medical invoices and receipts as they become available. Added claim note to review PIP submissions once receipts are uploaded.
