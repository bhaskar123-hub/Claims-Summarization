Spoke with the claimant at 708-1234 regarding the extent of visible damages and locations affected. The claimant described interior water damage to two rooms and provided estimates verbally for temporary repairs. I documented observed damage descriptions and requested timeline-specific photos showing before and after mitigation. Scheduled an on-site inspection and asked claimant to retain receipts for any emergency services.
