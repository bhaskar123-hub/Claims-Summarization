Called the claimant at 708-1234 to discuss coverage specifics and deductible implications. The claimant had questions about replacement cost versus actual cash value and I explained relevant policy language and limits. I advised the claimant on expected timelines for coverage determination and the documents that will be used to substantiate the claim. Confirmed claimant understands next steps and will provide the requested receipts.
