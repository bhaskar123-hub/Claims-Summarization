Completed the second stage file review after contractor estimates were received and compared against initial photo evidence. I summarized the discrepancies and prepared notes for the estimator meeting. I informed claimant at 312-3456 of the planned valuation approach and next steps to finalize settlement range. Noted pending items that must be resolved before final determination.
