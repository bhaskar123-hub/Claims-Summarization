Called the claimant at 415-6789 to confirm property ownership and primary contact details for the file. The claimant supplied updated mailing address and emergency contact which I recorded in the system. We discussed the claim timeline and the claimant provided a detailed chronology of actions taken immediately after the loss. I requested supporting receipts and photos and set expectations for the next communication.
